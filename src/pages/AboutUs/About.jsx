              <p>
                Our operational roots go back to 2002, when Deyaar established
                and grew a dedicated in-house maintenance department to oversee
                the day-to-day maintenance of its portfolio of properties in the
                UAE.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deyaar Facilities Management became functional as a division of
